The batch file in this directory, convert_HEIC_to_PNG.bat, 
will convert every image in a proprietary apple format into a standard PNG.
to use this with other directories, 
just move the .bat file into the directory that you would like to convert

because of a windows bug, sometimes the command prompt that opens when the batch file runs will go black - this is
only a visual bug and can be fixed by clicking on the command prompt and pressing any key, which will reset the display.
